# MedNotes
Just a little repo to store my notes from the last-day cramming sessions
 for my MBBS finals. Ended up adding to these even after the finals tho.
 The topics are arranged kinda randomly but thanks to LaTeX there's a nice
 table of contents which you can use to navigate through the material with
 relative ease. 

 Disclaimer: While I've taken much care to compile these nuggets
 of useful information, it's unlikely that they're devoid of errors.
 All the errors herein are my own. Use at your own peril.
