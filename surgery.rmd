## Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
Formation of semisolid coagulum in a deep vein.

### Virchow's triad
- Abnormal surface (endothelial damage)
- Abnormal flow (stasis / turbulence)
- Abnormal blood (thrombophilia)

### Factors
- Immobility
	- Age
	- Obesity
	- Prolonged surgery
	- Pregnancy
	- Puerperium
	- Varicosity (effect of immobility, the rest are causes)
- Hormone-replacement therapy (high oestrogen)
- Previous DVT / PE
- Thrombophilia

### Common sites
- Popliteal vein
- Femoral ""
- Iliac ""

# CABG
## Investigations for IHD
- ECG (first line)
- Cardiac enzymes (in acute coronary syndrome)
- Exercise tolerance test
- Echo: Evaluate
	- ventricular function
	- regional wall motion abnormalities
	- valvular lesions
- **Coronary angiography: gold std**
	- Extent, severity and location of stenoses
	- >70% reduction of diameter (i.e. >90% reduction of cross-sec) => severe
	 
## Indications for surgery
- >50% stenosis of the left coronary artery ("_left main stem_")
- >50% stenosis of the proximal _LAD_
- 2/3 main coronary arteries diseased (_RCA, LAD, LCx_)
