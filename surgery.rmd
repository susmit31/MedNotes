# Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
Formation of semisolid coagulum in a deep vein.

## Virchow's triad
- Abnormal surface (endothelial damage)
- Abnormal flow (stasis / turbulence)
- Abnormal blood (thrombophilia)

## Factors
- Immobility
	- Age
	- Obesity
	- Prolonged surgery
	- Pregnancy
	- Puerperium
	- Varicosity (effect of immobility, the rest are causes)
- Hormone-replacement therapy (high oestrogen)
- Previous DVT / PE
- Thrombophilia

## Common sites
- Popliteal vein
- Femoral ""
- Iliac ""

## Prevention
- Early mobilization
- Hydration
- Compression stockings
- Prophylactic LMW heparin
- Calf pumps
- Minimal use of tourniquets




# CABG
## Investigations for IHD
- ECG (first line)
- Cardiac enzymes (in acute coronary syndrome)
- Exercise tolerance test
- Echo: Evaluate
	- ventricular function
	- regional wall motion abnormalities
	- valvular lesions
- **Coronary angiography: gold std**
	- Extent, severity and location of stenoses
	- >70% reduction of diameter (i.e. >90% reduction of cross-sec) => severe
	 
## Indications for surgery
- >50% stenosis of the left coronary artery ("_left main stem_")
- >50% stenosis of the proximal _LAD_
- 2/3 main coronary arteries diseased (_RCA, LAD, LCx_)

## Graft selection
### Types
- **Venous**: long saphenous vein
- **Arterial**:
	- LIMA most common (left internal mammary / left internal thoracic artery)
	- Others
		- RIMA
		- Radial
		- Gastroepiploic
		- Inf epigastric




# Transfusion

## Indications
- Acute blood loss
- Periop anaemia
- Symptomatic chronic anaemia

## Complications
### Single transfusion
- Haemolysis (haemolytic transfusion reaction)
- Fever (febrile transfusion reaction)
- Allergic reaction
- Infections
	- Hep B, C
	- HIV
	- Malaria
	- Bacterial inf
- Air embolism
- Thrombophlebitis
- TRALI

### Massive transfusion
- Coagulopathy
- Hypothermia
- Hypo-Ca
- Hypo-K
- Hyper-K

## Clinical factoids
- Target Hb level: 10g/dL
- 1 unit transfusion = 1g/dL improvement





# Burns
## Assessment
- Rule of 9:
	- First approx
	- Adult
		- Head-neck $\rightarrow$ 9%
		- Each upper limb $\rightarrow$ 9%
		- Torso front 18%
		- Torso back 18%
		- Each lower limb 18%
		- Perineum 1%
- Lund and Browder chart
	- More accurate
- For smaller burns, a piece of small paper about the size of the hand to measure 
the burnt area directly. Size of hand $\approx$ 1%.
