# Preface {-}
What follows are my own notes on various topics in medicine,
 mostly based off of the following sources:
 
-  _Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine_ 23rd ed.,
-  _Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine_ 10th ed.,
-  _Long Cases in Clinical Medicine_ 2nd ed.,
-  _Short Cases in Clinical Medicine_ 6th ed.

The date below tells you the last time when I edited this
 document, so refer to that if you're worried about the temporal validity
 of the contents. The chapters are arranged somewhat at random, partly
 reflecting the order in which I studied them. These notes are,
 first and foremost, for my personal use, so pardon the inconvenience.
 Over time I will try tidying things up more.
 There's probably plenty of mistakes, all my own.
 **Use at your own peril.**

# Cardiology
## Presenting problems in CVS disease
### Features of benign murmur
- Soft
- Midsystolic
- Heard at left sternal edge
- No radiation
- No other cardiac abnormalities

## ECG
### Anatomy of an ECG
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../assets/med/ecg-anatomy.jpg}
	\caption{Parts of a normal ECG}
\end{figure}

### Abnormalities of components
#### Pathological Q
- Depth > 2mm
- Height > 1mm
- Present in $\ge$ 2 leads
- Assocd with loss of R height (Q > R/4; normally Q $\le$ R/4)
- **Indicates _transmural_ myocardial necrosis**

#### Segments vs intervals
- e.g. ST segment = end of S $\rightarrow$ start of T
- PR interval = start of P $\rightarrow$ start of R

#### ST segment elevation
- Normal: upto 1mm in limb leads, upto 2mm in chest leads
- **Causes**
	- **STEMI:** **convexity** upwards
	- **Acute periCArditis:**: **conCAvity** upwards
- **Indicates ongoing myocardial injury**

### Myocardial infarction
[A somewhat interesting physiological explanation on how the changes arise](
	https://www.cvphysiology.com/CAD/CAD012
)

#### Sites of infarction based on lead
- Septal: V$_1$, V$_2$
- Anterior: V$_3$, V$_4$
- Lateral: I, aVL, V$_5$, V$_6$
- Extensive anterior: V$_1$-V$_6$
- Anterolateral: I, aVL, V$_1$-V$_6$

#### Reciprocal changes
- Acute STEMI in some surface of the heart $\rightarrow$ ST elevation in
 corresponding leads, and ST depression in reciprocal leads 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../assets/med/reciprocal-leads.jpg}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak

#### Evolution over time of the ECG appearance of STEMI
- STEMI = **complete proximal occlusion of major coronary artery**

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../assets/med/STEMI.jpg}
\end{figure}


\begin{center}
$\fbox{A. Before the onset of infarction}$\\
$\downarrow$\\
$\fbox{B. In acute phase, ST elevation}$\\
$\downarrow$\\
$\fbox{C. Progressive loss of R and deepening Q}$\\
$\downarrow$\\
$\fbox{D. Resolution of ST elevation; fully developed pathological Q;
T inversion}$\\
$\downarrow$\\
$\fbox{E. In old infarcts, T-wave inversion may or may not persist}$\\
\end{center}


- ST elevation resolves after a few days

\pagebreak

#### NSTEMI
- **Partial occlusion of major** or **complete occlusion of minor** coronary
 artery
- _Subendocardial/partial-thickness MI_ $\rightarrow$ **no pathological Q**
- **ST depression** + **T inversion** in chest leads

## Coronary Artery Disease
- Diseases arising due to narrowing of the lumen of one or more coronary
 arteries and the resulting ischaemia/infarction of the myocardium or
 the conductive system.
- **Types**:
	 - Stable angina: Fixed atheromatous stenosis
	 - Unstable angina:
	 	- dynamic obstruction
	 	- due to plaque rupture/erosion with thrombosis
	 - MI
	 - Heart failure
	 - Arrhythmia
	 - Sudden cardiac death
	 	- ventricular arrhythmia
	 	- asystole
	 	- massive MI

## Arrhythmias
### Classification according to ECG morphology
- **Narrow complex**: QRS < 120ms (3 small sqs)
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Atrial fibrillation (irregular narrow complex tachycardia)
	- Atrial flutter
	- AV Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia (AVNRT aka SVT)

- **Broad complex**: QRS > 120ms (3 small sqs)
	- Ventricular tachycardia
	- AV Re-entry Tachycardia (AVRT e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)
		- Abnormal band of conductive tissue connecting atria and ventricles
		 (accessory pathway)

### Management of SVT
- Carotid sinus massage or
- Valsalva manoeuvre
- If the manoeuvre fails,
	- Adenosine (3-12mg IV) or
	- Rate-limiting CCB (Verapamil 5mg IV) or
	- $\beta$-blocker
- If haemodynamic state compromised, DC cardioversion
- Recurrent SVT $\rightarrow$ catheter ablation

## Atrial fibrillation
### Causes
- **Cardiac**
	- CAD (including acute MI)
	- Mitral stenosis (MS; rheumatic mitral valve disease)
	- Hypertension
	- Cardiomyopathy
- **Non-cardiac**
	- Thyrotoxicosis
	- Pulmonary embolism
	- Pneumonia
	- Alcoholism

### Investigations
- ECG
- Echo: to see valvular condition
- Thyroid function test: to exclude thyrotoxicosis

### Management of AF
- **Rhythm control**:
	- Pharmacological cardioversion
		- Pt stable + no history of heart disease $\rightarrow$ IV flecainide
		- Structural / ischaemic heart disease $\rightarrow$ IV amiodarone
	- DC cardioversion if drugs fail
- **Rate control**
	- $\beta$-blockers
	- Digoxin
	- Rate-limiting CCB: verapamil / diltiazem
- **Thromboprophylaxis:**
	- Oral Warfarin
	- Target INR: 2.0-3.0
	- Reduces risk of stroke by $\frac{2}{3}$
	- Start 4wks before cardioversion, continue till 3mo after successful
	 cardioversion

# Dermatology
## Anatomy and physiology
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../assets/surg/skin-layers.jpg}
	\caption{Layers of the skin}
\end{figure}

- **Layers of skin**:
	- **Epidermis**: further layered into (from out$\rightarrow$in)
		- corneum
		- lucidum
		- granulosum
		- spinosum
		- basale
	- **Dermis**: 
		- **Papillary dermis**: more superficial part, containing
			- loose areolar tissue
			- subpapillary vascular plexus
		- **Reticular dermis**: deeper part, containing
			- collagen
			- deep vascular plexus
			- nerves
			- pilosebaceous units (hair follicle + sebaceous gland)
			- sweat glands
			- some keratinocytes around the hair follicles and sweat glands
			 (important for wound healing - these are the reasons behind
			 healing without scarring in upto partial-thickness skin wounds)
	- Subcutis / subcutaneous tissue: (technically not part of the skin)
	 adipose tissue

### Epidermal appendages
- Hair follicles:
	- phases of growth
		- anagen: 
			- active growth
			- lasts years in scalp hairs
		- catagen: 
			- transitional
			- lasts days (in scalp)
		- telogen: 
			- resting
			- lasts months (in scalp)
- Sebaceous glands
	- usually _associated with a hair follicle_
	- $\fbox{androgens}\rightarrow$ **$\uparrow$** $\fbox{sebum}$
	- $\fbox{oestrogen}\rightarrow$ **$\downarrow$** $\fbox{sebum}$
- Sweat glands
	- innerved by _sympathetic cholinergic_ fibres

## Principles of management of skin disease
### Topical treatments
- Ointments vs Creams
	- Ointments preferred to creams for dry skin (e.g. chronic eczema) as
		- more hydrating
			- 80% oil + 20% water in ointments (vs 50-50 for creams) $\rightarrow$
		 	prevent water loss from skin by oil layer
		- less preservatives $\rightarrow$ less risk of allergy
- Emollients
	- Moisturise, lubricate, protect skin
	- _Vehicles without active drug_
- Gluocorticoids

### Phototherapy
- **UVB**
- **Psoralen UVA**
	- Psoralen:
		- natural photosensitiser from plant source
		- cross-link DNA strands on excitation with UVA
	- Cumulative exposure to PUVA $\rightarrow\;\;\uparrow$
	 risk of SCC, so reserved for UVB resistance
- Uses
	- Psoriasis
	- Atopic eczema
	- Vitiligo
	- Chronic urticaria

### Systemics
- Antihistamines
- **Retinoids**
	- _Anti-inflammatory_
	- Promote _differentiation of skin cells_
	- **Teratogenic**
		- must be prescribed with robust contraception
		- females must have negative pregnancy test before, during, and after
		 therapy
- **Immunosuppressants**
	- Glucocorticoids e.g. prednisolone
	- Methotrexate
	- Azathioprine

### Biologics
- Biological _inhibitors_ of _proinflammatory cytokines_
- **TNF-$\alpha$ inhibitors**
	- Infliximab
	- Etanercept
- **Interleukin inhibitors**
	- Ustekinumab: IL-12, 23
	- Guselkumab: IL-23
	- Secukinumab: IL-17
- _Rituximab_:
	- Binds to CD20 $\rightarrow$ cause ADCC of B cells
	- As terminally differentiated plasma cells don't have CD20 they're safe
	- Use: pemphigus vulgaris

### Non-surgical therapy
- **Cryo**
	- _Liquid N$_2$_
	- Causes cell membrane destruction $\rightarrow$ death
- Laser
- PDT / photodynamic therapy

## Skin cancers
### Classification
- Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC): most common
	- SCC
	- BCC
- Melanoma
	- Less common
	- More metastatic risk $\rightarrow$ cause of most skin cancer deaths


## Fungal infections
### Types
- Superficial
	- Dermatophytes: aka **ringworm / tineasis**
		- _Trichophyton_
		- _Epidermophyton_
		- _Microsporum_
			
	- Yeast
- Deep: less common
	- Chromomycosis
	- Sporotrichosis

## Scabies
### Agent
Caused by the mite _Sarcoptis scabies hominis_

### Diagnosis
- Identify the skin burrow 
- Visualize the mite by dermatoscope / extracting with a needle

### Treatment
- Affected + all asymptomatic family members / physical contacts
- Topical permethrin / malathion
	- 2 applications
	- 1 wk apart
	- Whole body, except head
- Oral Ivermectin:
	- Single dose
	- For poor adherence, immunosuppresion or heavy infestation


## Acne
- _Chronic inflammation_ of _pilosebaceous_ units

### Pathogenesis
Key components are:

- $\uparrow$ Sebum production
- Colonisation of pilosebaceous ducts by _Propionibacterium acnes_
- Occlusion of pilosebaceous ducts

### Features

- Greasiness of skin

### Management
- **Mild disease**
	- Topical Benzoyl peroxide
	- Topical Retinoids
	- Topical antibiotics
		- Erythromycin
		- Clindamycin
- **Moderate disease**: topical _plus_
	- Systemic tetracycline
	- Oestrogen containing OCP
	- Isotretinoin: if inadequate response to topical+systemic therapy
	 for 6 months
- **Severe disease**
	- Isotretinoin 0.5-1 mg/kg for 4 months:
		- Reduce sebum secretion and follicle colonisation
		- Teratogen
		- Pregnancy must be avoided during treatment _and_ within 2 mo of
		 drug cessation
	- Systemic glucocorticoid (with isotretinoin)
	- If unable to use isotretinoin
		- UVB phototherapy
		- PDT

## Eczemas
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis is associated with _Malassezia_ yeasts

- **Characteristics**
	- **Well-defined erythematous scaly plaques**
	- Affecting **extensor surfaces, scalp, nails**

### Histological features

# Nephrology
## Presenting problems in urinary disease
- **Oliguria:** < 400mL/day
- **Anuria:** < 100mL/day
- **Haematuria:**
	- Healthy indiviuals may have upto 12,500 RBCs/mL
	- Macroscopic or microscopic-dipstick+ haematuria indicates significant
	 pathology
- **Proteinuria:**
	- Very small amounts of high molecular weight and moderate amounts of
	 low molecular weight proteins pass through the healthy GBM (glomerular
	 basement membrane)
	- Whatever passes is also completely reabsorbed by receptors on tubular
	 cells
	- So in healthy individuals, < 150mg/day protein excreted through urine
	- Transient proteinuria
		- Causes
			- Vigorous exercise
			- Fever
			- Heart failure
			- UTI
		- Retest after trigger has resolved to verify if persistent
		 proteinuria
	- Proteinuria best tested on early morning sample, as some have
	 orthostatic proteinuria (benign, < 1g/day, associated with upright
	 posture)
	- Dipstick positive when > 0.5 g/day
		- If persistent dipstick proteinuria, 24h urinary protein must
		 be quantified. > 1g/day $\rightarrow$ likely glomerular disease
		- PCR (Protein:Creatinine ratio) in spot sample might give better
		 estimates than 24h protein as 24h urine collection is often inaccurate
		- Renal biopsy to confirm dx in significant proteinuria
		
## Glomerular diseases ("Glomerulonephritides")
### Introduction
- Though strictly means inflammation of the glomeruli, used to describe
 all glomerular disease (even if non-inflammatory e.g. minimal change 
 disease)
- Lie on a _spectrum_, from _nephrosis_ (podocyte pathology $\rightarrow$
 proteinuria) to _nephritis_ (inflammation + GBM damage $\rightarrow$
 haematuria)

### Types
#### Nephrotic presentation
- **Minimal change disease**
	- Normal except on electron microscopy
	- Electron microscopy shows fusion of podocyte foot processes
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
- **Membranous nephropathy**

#### Mild glomerulonephritic presentation
- IgA nephropathy
- Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis

#### Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritic presentation
- Focal necrotising glomerulonephritis
- Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
- Anti-GBM disease (aka Goodpasture's syndrome)


\section[Nephrotic syndrome]
	{Nephrotic syndrome
		\footnote
			{Most parts of this section, unless specifically
 			mentioned to be for membranous nephropathy, refers to minimal
 			change disease i.e. (most cases of) paediatric nephrotic
 			syndrome}}

### Features
- Massive **proteinuria** (> 3.5 g/day (medicine) or 1 g/m$^2$/day (paediatrics))
	- **Hypoalbuminaemia** (< 3 g/dL)
	- Generalised **oedema** (pitting)
	- **"Effusions":** Ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion
- Features of reduced circulatory volume
	- Scanty urination (colour normal)
	- Pulse: weak
	- BP: low
	- Capillary refill: prolonged (> 3s)
- Hyperlipidaemia & lipiduria
	- due to $\uparrow$ lipoprotein production by liver
- **Recurrent infections**
	- loss of immunoglobulins with urine
- Features of **complications**
	- Shiny abdominal wall, rigidity and tenderness, absent bowel sounds
	 $\rightarrow$ **peritonitis**, likely by _Strep pneumo_
	- Palpable kidney + haematuria $\rightarrow$ **renal vein thrombosis**
	- Alterations of consciousness, hemiplegia $\rightarrow$ **stroke** 

### Histopathology
- Histological types include
	- **Minimal change disease:**
		- no pathology visible with light microscope,
		 visible pathology only under electron microscope.
	 	- most common type in **children** (2-8y)
	- **Membranous nephropathy:** most common type in **adults**


### Aetiopathogenesis

		\caption{Membranous nephropathy}
	\end{subfigure}
	\vspace{5mm}
	\caption{Pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome}
\end{figure}

#### Minimal change disease
- **Effacement of podocyte foot processes**

#### Membranous nephropathy
- **Autoantibodies to podocyte surface antigens** (e.g. M-type phospholipase
 A$_2$ receptor 1)$\rightarrow$ **MAC-mediated glomerular capillary injury**
 	- Antibodies to phospholipase A$_2$ (PLA2Rab), thus, can be used for
 	 diagnosis without biopsy (but may be absent in early disease so biopsy
 	 might still be needed)
- Aetiology:
	- Primary / Idiopathic: HLA-DQA1
	- Secondary:
		- Drugs e.g. NSAIDs, penicillamine (treatment for Wilson's)
		- Heavy metal poisoning
		- Hep-B
		- Malignancy
		- SLE
- Fates:
	- 1/3 spontaneous remission
	- 1/3 remain nephrotic
	- 1/3 progressive CKD


### Investigations
- Urine RME
	- Albuminuria
	- Granular & hyaline casts
	- Pus cells if associated with UTI
- Diagnostic
	- 24h total protein: > 1g/m$^2$/day
	- PCR (Protein-Creatinine ratio) > 2 
	- Serum albumin < 25 g/L
	- Serum cholesterol > 220 mg/dL
- Renal biopsy: if nonresponsive to corticosteroid therapy

### Treatment
#### Minimal Change Nephropathy
- **Specific:**^[https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO-GD-Guideline-Key-Takeaways-for-Clinicians-Nephrotic-Syndrome-in-Children.pdf]
	- **High dose glucocorticoid for 6wks**
	- Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day
	- KDIGO guidelines: (4wks daily + 4wks alternate day) or
	 (6wks daily + 6wks	 alternate day)
- **Supportive:**
	- Diet:
		- normal with adequate protein
		- salt restriction
	- Oedema: if severe,
		- restrict salt and fluid intake
		- loop diuretics
	- Hypovolaemia: infuse albumin
	- Infections: treat & prevent (pneumococcus, meningococcus vaccine)
	- Hypercoagulability: 
		- due to loss of coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III, protein C,
		 protein S) + $\uparrow$ liver production of procoagulants
		- consider LMW heparin / warfarin if severe NS

#### Membranous Nephropathy
- **Specific:**^[https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO-GD-Guideline-Key-Takeaways-for-Clinicians-Membranous-Nephropathy.pdf]
	- **High-dose glucocorticoids + cyclophosphamide** (Ponticelli regimen)
		- Reserved for severe cases for risk of toxicity of this regimen
	- If secondary,  **treat the underlying cause**
- **Supportive:** same as above

## Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
### Pathogenesis
- Occurs following sore throat or skin infection by **group-A $\beta$-haemolytic
 streptococcus** (nephritogenic strains: 12, 49)
- **Antibodies against streptococcal M protein cross-react** with
 glomerular antigens because of molecular mimicry
- Complement activation, inflammatory cell infiltration. Net effects:
	- **Oliguria**
	- **Haematuria**
	- Hypervolaemia, **hypertension**, hyperkalaemia
	- **Oedema**
	- **$\downarrow$ Renal function** $\implies$
		- Azotaemia
		- Acidosis
- **Complications** (due mostly to acute hypertension)
	- Acute LVF
	- Hypertensive encephalopathy
	- Acute kidney injury

### Features
- Age: 5-12y; history of strep throat/skin infection a few wks prior
- Scanty, smoky urine
- Puffy face
- Hypertension
- Features of complications
	- $\fbox{ALVF}$:
		- cough
		- respiratory distress
		- orthopnoea
		- gallop rhythm
		- bilateral basal crepitations
	- $\fbox{Hypertensive encephalopathy}$:
		- headache, blurred vision, convulsion, delirium, papilloedema
	- $\fbox{AKI}$: anuria

### Investigations
- **Evidence of nephritis**
	- Urine RME:
		- RBC, RBC casts
		- Mild proteinuria
		- Leucocytes
	- Serum C3: $\downarrow$
	- Serum C4: normal
- **Evidence of prior strep infection**
	- ASO titre: $\uparrow$
	- Anti-DNAse B: $\uparrow$
- **Evidence of complications**
	- Serum electrolytes: may show hyperkalaemia and acidosis
	- Serum creatinine
	- X-ray chest

### Treatment
- **Rest**
- **Diet**: restrict fluid, salt, protein.
- **Diuretics**: furosemide
- **Antibiotics**: phenoxymethyl penicillin PO to prevent spread of
 remaining strep within the body
- **Antihypertensive**


## Alport's syndrome
- Mutation / deletion of COL4A5 on chr-X $\rightarrow$ **defect of collagen
 type IV**
- **X-linked recessive**
- $\fbox{Deposition of abnormal collagen}\;\rightarrow\;
	\fbox{progressive degeneration of GBM}$
	 - Haematuria starts in early infancy
	 - ESRD by late teens / twenties
	 - Female carriers usually have haematuria, rarely significant
	  renal disease
- Other basement membranes with collagen IV are also involved
	- cochlear BM $\rightarrow$ **SNHL** (sensorineural hearing loss;
	 especially in high-frequencies)
	- **ocular abnormalities**:
		- lenticonus
		- keratoconus
		- cataracts
		- corneal erosions
- ACEi may slow (but not prevent) loss of renal function
- Might require RRT (renal replacement therapy)


## Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease
### Introduction
- Better known as Autosomal Dominant PKD (ADPKD)
	- There's a much rarer (1:20,000) autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD)
- Prevalence 1:1000
- **Autosomal dominant**
- Small cysts lined by tubular epithelium develop from childhood, enlarge
 slowly
- Surrounding normal kidney tissue compressed and progressively damaged
- Mutations: PKD1 (in 85%), PKD2 (15%) (code for polycystin 1 and 2,
 respectively)

### Features
- Asymptomatic initially
- **Hypertension** from around 20 yrs of age
- Either (or both) kidney may be palpable, nodular
- Vague **loin discomfort** due to **enlarging mass**
- Acute loin pain due to haemorrhage into a cyst
- **Haematuria** with little / no proteinuria
- About 30% have **hepatic cysts** (mostly with no liver function impairment)
- **Berry aneurysms** of cerebral vessels in $\approx$ 5% (may lead to SAH)
- **Renal failure** $\rightarrow$ features of CKD
- Mitral / aortic regurgitation (frequent, rarely severe)

## Renal artery stenosis
### Introduction
- **Most common cause of 2$^{\circ}$ hypertension**
- Most cases are due to **atherosclerosis**
- Younger ($\le$ 40) cases mostly non-atheromatous, due to _fibromuscular
 dysplasia_

### Features
- Hypertension: may be severe and difficult to control
- Acute pulmonary oedema: associated with severe hypertension
- Progressive renal failure
- Worsened renal function with ACEi or ARB administration ($\ge$ 30%
 increase in serum creatinine raises possibility of renal artery
 stenosis)
- Peripheral vascular disease: associated, but not caused by the stenosis
	- In older patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis
	 (due to generalised atherosclerosis)
	- Especially in legs

### Investigations
- CT / MR angiogram of renal vasculature: confirmatory
- Serum creatinine: to see if worsening renal function
- Plasma renin: may be elevated
- Serum electrolytes: may be hypokalaemia due to hyperaldosteronism
- USG: asymmetrically sized kidneys

### Treatment
#### Medical
- Antihypertensives: not ACEi or ARB
- Lipid-lowering agents: Statins
- Anti-platelets: Low-dose aspirin 

#### Surgical
- Angioplasty
- Indications:
	- $\le$ 40y age
	- BP not controlled by antihypertensive / history of malignant htn
	- History of flash pulmonary oedema
	- Deteriorating renal function

## Thrombotic microangiopathies (HUS, TTP)
### Introduction
- Thrombotic occlusion of arterioles and capillaries especially in
 the kidneys or brain
- Common feature of these is **microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA)**
	- Haemolysis due to passage of RBCs through abnormal vessels
	- **Schistocytes** (fragmented RBC) may be seen on PBF
	- **Reticulocytosis**
	- **$\uparrow$ unconjugated bilirubin, serum LDH**
	- **$\downarrow$ serum haptoglobin**
		- Lysed RBCs release free Hb into the bloodstream. This can enter
		 into tissues and trigger the inflammatory cascade, leading to
		 tissue damage. To protect from this, the body comes equipped with
		 a plasma protein called _haptoglobin_, which binds to free Hb.
		 When there's intravascular haemolysis, free Hb is released, and
		 haptoglobin is used up, leading to its decreased serum levels.

### Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
- Thrombotic microangiopathy predominantly involving renal microcirculation
- Cause: **shiga-like toxin producing bacteria**
	- Enterohaemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_
	- _Shigella dysenteriae_
- Most common cause of AKI in children
- If no bloody diarrhoea, atypical causes of HUS (e.g. complement system
 abnormalities - familial HUS) should be considered

### Thrombotic thrombocytopoenic purpura
- Thrombotic microangiopathy predominantly involving cerebral
 microcirculation
- MAHA + thrombocytopoenia
- Autoimmune: antibodies to ADAMTS-13
	- aka vWF cleaving protease
		- functions of vWF: haemostasis (thrombus + clot)
			- bind to and stabilize Factor VIII (unbound half-life: 1h,
			 bound to vWF: 12h)
			- help platelet aggregation
	- destruction of ADAMTS-13 $\rightarrow\;\;\uparrow$ vWF $\rightarrow$
	 thrombosis

## Acute kidney injury (AKI)
### Definition
- Sudden, (usually) reversible loss of renal function, developing over
 days or weeks, evidenced by rising serum creatinine and / or falling GFR.
- KDIGO criteria^[
	https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdf
]: presence of any of the following
	- _$\Delta$SCr $\ge$ +0.3 mg/dL over 48h_
	- _$\Delta$SCr $\ge$ +0.5x baseline_ (or SCr $\ge$ 1.5x baseline)
	 _over 7d_
	- _Urine volume $\le$ 0.5 mL/kg/h for $\ge$ 6h_

### Causes
#### Pre-renal
- Cardiac failure
- Blood loss
- Dehydration
- Burns
- Sepsis

#### Renal
- _AGN_ (acute glomerulonephritis)
- _AIN_ (acute interstitial nephritis)
	- Drugs
	- Toxins
	- Inflammatory disease
	- Infection
- _ATN_ (acute tubular necrosis)
	- Drugs
	- Toxins
	- Prolonged hypotension

#### Post-renal
- Bilateral renal stone
- BEP (benign enlargement of prostate)
- Bladder / prostate / cervical cancer
- Urethral stricture
- Meatal stenosis
- Phimosis

### Features
- Pre-renal: features of shock
- Renal: 
	- AGN: haematuria, mild proteinuria, oedema, htn
	- AIN: worsened renal function following drugs (PPIs, penicillins,
	 NSAIDs)
	- ATN: dense granular ("muddy brown") casts
- Post-renal: bladder distension, hydronephrosis on USG

### Management
- Assess **fluid status**
	- If hypovolaemic, fluid resuscitation and inotropes as needed
	- Once euvolaemic, fluid intake = urine output + 500mL (for covering
	 insensible loss)
	- If hypervolaemic, diuretics
- Manage **hyperkalaemia**
	- If K$^+$ > 6.5 mmol/L
		- **Calcium resonium** to _stabilize myocardium_
		- **Glucose + Insulin** to _reduce K_
- Manage **acidosis**
	- NaHCO$_3$ if pH < 7
- **Treat the cause**
- Discontinue nephrotoxic drugs
- Reduce doses of other drugs according to renal function
- Diet: sufficient energy and protein while avoiding high protein intake
 (as renal function is poor, metabolic wastes from protein i.e. urea
 will accumulate in blood leading to uraemia)
- **Renal replacement therapy**: if not improving with the above measures 

\pagebreak

## UTI
### Definition
- Presence of > 10$^5$ organisms/mL in a mid-stream sample of urine (if
 asymptomatic). 

### Features

### Joint fluid aspiration
- Normal:
	- Amount small

### DEXA (Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry)
- Measure BMD (bone mineral density)
	- < -2.5 $\rightarrow$ osteoporosis
	- Between -2.5 and -1 $\rightarrow$ osteopoenia
	- \> 2.5 $\rightarrow$ high bone mass (most common cause osteoarthritis)

### Immunology

	 then 100% sensitive); specificity poor
	- **RF +ve diseases**
		- Rheumatoid arthritis
		- Sjogren's syndrome
		- SLE
		- Old age (> 65)

	 by peptidylarginine deiminase, an enzyme abundant in inflamed synovium.
	- 70% sensitive, >95% specific for RA
- **ANA** (antinuclear antibodies)
	- 100% sensitive for SLE but poor specificity
	- **ANA +ve diseases**
		- SLE
		- Sjogren's
		- Systemic sclerosis
		- Rheumatoid arthritis
- **Complement C3**
	- Active SLE $\rightarrow\;\;\downarrow$ C3  (due to consumption of C3
	 by immune complexes)

## Seropositive vs Seronegative arthritis

		- **Conjunctivitis**
		- **Urethritis**
		- **Reactive arthritis**
	- Due to _Chlamydia_

# Neurology
## Raised ICP
- Normal ICP = **5-15 mmHg**

### Causes
- **ICSOL**
	- Intracranial haemorrhage
	- Tumours e.g. glioma
	- Brain abscess
- **Hydrocephalus**: blockade of CSF circulation
	- Obstructive / non-communicating
	- Communicating
- **Cerebral oedema** e.g. meningoencephilitis
- **Venous sinus obstruction** e.g. cerebral venous thrombosis

### Features
- **Headache**
- **Vomiting**
- **Diplopia / blurred vision**: Due to _6th nerve palsy_
	- 6th nerve palsy due to
		- stretching of the long, slender nerve
		- compression against petrous temporal bone
	- This palsy of the 6th nerve secondary to raised ICP is known as a
	 _false localisation sign_. If the patient presented only with visible
	 features of 6th nerve palsy, (e.g. diplopia, medial squint) we would
	 falsely localise the primary defect to the 6th nerve. So in
	 6th nerve palsy always exclude RICP by looking for papilloedema. 
- **Depressed consciousness**
- **Papilloedema**
- **Bradycardia**
- **Hypertension**

### Management
- According to cause:
	- Mass lesion $\rightarrow$ surgical decompression
	- Hydrocephalus $\rightarrow$ _ventriculoperitoneal shunt_ operation
	- Oedema $\rightarrow$ glucocorticoids
- Supportive:
	- Head elevation
	- Fluid balance
	- BP control
	- Diuretics: mannitol

## Neurological emergencies
- **Status epilepticus**
- **Stroke** (if thrombo)
- **Subarachnoid haemorrhage**
- **Cord compression**
- **GBS**
- **Myasthenia gravis** (if bulbar and/or respiratory)

\pagebreak

## Status epilepticus
### Definition
- Continuous or recurrent **seizures** for **$\ge$ 30 mins without gain of
 consciousness** in between.
- Clinically we assume SE after 5mins of seizure activity.

### Management
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../assets/med/stat-epi.png}


## All jerks root values
- Biceps: C5
- Supinator: C6
- Triceps: C7
- Finger (aka Hoffmann test): C8
- Knee: L3, L4
- Ankle: S1, S2
- Plantar: S1 (technically not a jerk since it's a superficial reflex)

\pagebreak

## Subarachnoid haemorrhage
### Causes
- Ruptured berry aneurysm (85%)
- Arterio-venous malformations

### Features
- Sudden severe "thunderclap" headache (often occipital)
- Vomiting
- High BP
- Neck stiffness
- May be loss of consciousness
- Photophobia

### Investigations
- CT scan: hyperdense material in the subarachnoid space
- Lumbar puncture: blood, xanthochromia

### Management
- **Nimodipine** 30-60mg IV for 5-14d, followed by 360mg oral for 7d
	- _prevents delayed ischaemia_
- Insertion of **Pt coils** into aneurysm
- **Surgical clipping** of the neck of the aneurysm
- Surgical removal if AVM

## Subacute combined degeneration
### Features
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: due to **demyelination**
- Signs of **dorsal column lesion**: **position and vibration sense lost**
- Signs of **pyramidal lesion**:
	- **plantar extensor**
	- **knee jerk brisk**
	- **ankle jerk absent**: as peripheral neuropathy affects longer nerves
	 first, the afferent pathway for ankle jerk is damaged by the PN while
	 the same for knee jerk is not. Combined with the corticospinal tract
	 lesion, this makes knee jerks brisk and ankle jerks absent.
- **Optic atrophy**:  death of retinal ganglion cell axons

## Cauda equina and Conus medullaris lesions
### Anatomy
\begin{figure}[h!]

		\vspace*{10mm}
		\caption{The Conus and the Cauda}

		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../assets/med/cauda-2.jpg}
		\caption{Vertebrae with corresponding spinal cord segments}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

- During development, the spine grows faster than the spinal cord, which
 is why the spinal nerves exit the spinal column at increasingly oblique
 angles.
- The spinal cord ends as the tapered conus medullaris at around L1.

\pagebreak

### Relevant physiology
- S2-4:
	- Parasympathetic fibres for bladder sphincter (activation causes
	 emptying)
	- Somatic fibres for pudendal nerves (activation causes relaxation of
	 urethral and anal sphincters $\rightarrow$ emptying).
- Conus is surrounded by spinal nerve roots bundled up together around it,
 so injury / compression in this region leads to a combination of UMN
 and LMN lesion features.
- Lesion in the cauda region leads only to LMN lesion features as there's
 no cord there.

## Neurogenic Bladder
### Physiological control of micturition: the Micturition Reflex
#### "Components"
- **Detrusor muscle**
	- Muscles of the bladder wall
	- Innervated by
		- **Parasympathetic:** 
			- cholinergic M$_3$ receptors
			- pelvic nerve from **S2-4**
			- causes **contraction** $\rightarrow$ **urination**
		- **Sympathetic:** 
			- $\beta_3$ receptors
			- hypogastric nerve from **T10-L2**
			- causes **relaxation** $\rightarrow$ **storage** / retention
- **Internal urethral sphincter**
	- Innervated by **only sympathetic**
		- hypogastric nerve from **T10-L2**
		- causes storage / retention
- **External urethral sphincter**
	- **Voluntary control** 
		- UMN from pontine micturition centre
		- LMN from S2-4 (pudendal nerve)
		- causes retention

#### The big picture (highest yield for clinical interpretation)
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../assets/med/micturition-reflex.png}
\end{figure}


\begin{center}
$\fbox{Lesion in S}$ $\rightarrow$ $\fbox{Stores (retention)}$\\
$\fbox{Lesion in L and above}$ $\rightarrow$ $\fbox{Leaks (incontinence)}$\\

\end{center}

- The reflex spontaneously tries to void the bladder upon being filled
 even by small amounts. The only thing holding it back is the pontine
 micturition centre which always inhibits the circuit, unless we voluntarily
 signal it not to. We can't signal the bladder to empty itself. We can only
 signal the micturition reflex to not hold back.
- The reflex circuit is composed of afferents and efferents from S2-4.
 So any **lesion above S2-4** will leave the circuit intact, while damaging
 the telephone lines from the pontine centre. The end result is that we lose
 the inhibition of the reflex (which fires every few mins after storing
 some tens of millilitres of urine), and without anything holding it back,
 there's urinary **incontinence**.
- On the other hand, any **lesion at S2-4** will damage the circuit
 elements themselves. That means that the reflex will be lost. This means
 we no longer have access to the bladder emptying circuit. So
 there will be urinary **retention**.

## Parkinson's disease
### Parkinsonism
- Triad of **TRH**: tremor, rigidity, hypokinesia (bradykinesia)
- **Causes**
	- Idiopathic $\rightarrow$ Parkinson's disease
	- Cerebrovascular disease
	- Drugs:
		- Antipsychotics (older)
		- Metoclopramide (D$_2$ blocker $\rightarrow$ undo D$_2$
		 mediated inhibition of cholinergic stimulation in GIT $\rightarrow$
		 $\uparrow$GI motility $\rightarrow$ antiemesis)
		 	- Domperidone, which is also a D$_2$ blocker, selectively acts
		 	 on D$_2$s in the GIT, so no parkinsonism 
		 	- Metoclopramide is nonselective
		- Na-valproate, Lithium
	- Other neurodegenerative diseases
		- Lewy body dementia
		- Multiple system atrophy
		- Alzheimer's
	- Genetic
		- Huntington's
		- Wilson's

### Pathophysiology
- Loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
- **Lewy bodies in nigral cells**: pathological hallmark
	- Eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions
	- Lewy body = aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein (hence the
	 alternative name $\alpha$-synucleinopathy)
	- Other $\alpha$-synucleinopathies (diseases associated with Lewy body
	 deposition (differ in the initial site of deposition and hence
	 initial features)):
		- Lewy body dementia
		- Multiple system atrophy


### Features
- Average age of onset: 60y
- First degreee relative with PD $\rightarrow$ 2-3x risk
- Progressive, incurable
- Initially motor symptoms dominate, but eventually nonmotor symptoms
 (e.g. depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment) become increasingly
 prominent
- Motor symptoms **initially asymmetrical**
- The hallmark is **bradykinesia**, which leads to
	- Micrographia (small handwriting)
	- Difficulty tying shoelaces / buttoning clothes
	- Difficulty rolling over in bed
- **Resting tremor** affecting limbs, chin and jaw but not the head
- **Rigidity**
- Soft, indistinct speech

#### Signs
- General:
	- Hypomimia (expressionless / mask-like face)
	- Dysphonia (soft, indistinct speech)
	- Flexed (stooped) posture with impaired postural reflexes
	- Bradykinesia
	- **Glabellar tap:**
		- tapping on glabella (above bridge of nose) $\rightarrow$ blink
		- normal $\rightarrow$ blinking stops after 3-5 times
		- Parkinson's $\rightarrow$ sustained blinking
- Gait: **Festinating gait**
	- Slow to start
	- Short, shuffling steps (festination)
	- Reduced arm swing
	- Impaired balance on turning (fractionated turn)
- Tremor:
	- First in arm/hand (**pill-rolling** tremor)
- Rigidity:
	- **Leadpipe rigidity**: 
		- better seen in elbow / knee
		- uniform throughout movement
	- **Cogwheel rigidity** (= tremor superimposed on rigidity) better
	 seen in wrist
	- Rigidity vs Spasticity:
		- Rigidity:
			- uniform resistance throughout range of motion
			- due to _extrapyramidal_ lesion
		- Spasticity:
			- initially increased resistance, followed by lessening
			- due to _pyramidal_ lesion
- The following will be normal (if abnormal, consider other causes)
	- Power, jerks, plantar
	- Eye movements
	- Sensory exam
	- Cerebellar exam

### Investigations
- Dx is clinical
- CT / MRI normal
- Functional dopaminergic imaging (SPECT / PET) abnormal even early
- In younger, exclude Huntington's and Wilson's

### Treatment
- **Only symptomatic, no cure**
- **Physiotherapy $\pm$ drugs** (drugs not given if mild)
- **Surgical:** on failure of medical therapy

#### Drugs
- **Levodopa + carbidopa**
	- Most effective in reducing **rigidity and bradykinesia**
	- **Role of dietary protein**: amino acids in dietary protein compete
	 with levodopa for intestinal absorption and transport across BBB
	 $\rightarrow\;\;\downarrow$ efficacy of levodopa
	- Side effects:
		- Postural hypotension
		- Nausea, vomiting
		- Hallucinations
	- Fluctuating response after 3-5y of use
		- _End of dose dyskinesia_: due to progressive loss of dopamine,
		 duration of action of levodopa becomes shorter. Freezing and
		 rigidity before next dose of levodopa.
		 	- Management: smaller, frequent dosage
		- _On-off phenomenon_: periods of severe parkinsonism (freezing
		 and immobility - _off period_) alternating with periods of
		 dopamine-induced dyskinesia / chorea (_on period_).
		 	- Management: lower levodopa dose, add selegiline with levodopa
	- Contraindications:
		- Psychosis
		- Narrow angle glaucoma
		- Malignant melanoma
		- PUD
- **Anticholinergics**
	- Benzhexol, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl
	- Reduce **tremor and rigidity**, not bradykinesia
	- Side effects:
		- Urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth
		- Worsening of glaucoma
	- Contraindications:
		- BEP
		- Narrow angle glaucoma
- **Dopamine receptor agonists**
	- Ergot-derived (e.g. bromocriptine) or non-ergot-derived (e.g.
	 ropinirole)
	- Compared to levodopa, less therapeutic effect, more side effects
	- Side effects:
		- Postural hypotension
		- Nausea, vomiting
		- Hallucination
		- Confusion
- **MAO-B inhibitors**
	- Selegiline, rasagiline
	- MAO-B facilitates dopamine breakdown $\rightarrow$ MAO-Bi potentiates
	 the action of levodopa by inhibiting breakdown
- **COMT inhibitors**
	- Tolcapone, entacapone
	- COMT $\rightarrow$ peripheral breakdown of levodopa
- **Amantadine**:
	- Rarely used unless patient unable to tolerate other drugs.
 	- Mild, short-lived effect.

#### Surgery
- **Deep brain stimulation**
	- Replaced destructive surgery
	- Targets: thalamus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nuclei
	- Thalamic stimulation $\rightarrow$ reduce tremor

	 $\rightarrow\;\;\uparrow$ insulin secretion 
	- **Side effects profile**
		- Wt gain
		- Hypoglycaemia
- **$\alpha$-glucosidase inhibitors:** Acarbose
	- **Mechanism of action**: delay absorption of carbs
	- **Side effects profile**
		- Non-hypoglycaemic
		- Flatulence
		- Bloating
		- Diarrhoea
- **Incretin-based therapies:**
	- **DPP-4 inhibitors:** Gliptins
		- **MoA**
			- DPP-4: breaks down GLP-1 & GIP $\rightarrow$ inhibit incretin
			 effect
	- **GLP-1 receptor agonists:** Exenatide, liraglutide 
- **Thiazolidinediones:** Pioglitazone
	- **Mechanism of action**
		- PPAR-$\gamma$ agonist $\rightarrow$ enhance action of insulin
	- **Side effects profile**
		- Non-hypoglycaemic
		- Wt gain (increase fat cells)
- **SGLT-2 inhibitors:** empagliflozin, dapagliflozin
	- **MoA:** inhibit reabsorption of glucose in renal tubules $\rightarrow$
	 25% of filtered glucose excreted
	- Resulting glycosuria can lead to genital fungal infections
	- Empagliflozin $\rightarrow$ 35% reduced mortality in heart failure

# Nutritional diseases
## Vitamins
### B$_1$ (thiamin) deficiency
#### Functions of thiamin
- Cofactor in different pathways of aerobic metabolism of glucose
	- decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-coA (so bridge between glycolysis
	 and Krebs)
	- decarboxylation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to succinate in Krebs

#### Features
- For its pivotal role in aerobic glucose meta, the largest blow is dealt
 to the tissues most dependent on glucose - the **brain** and the **heart**.
- **Beri-beri**
	- **Dry:** Neurological beri-beri
		- Peripheral neuropathy
		- Wrist/foot drop
		- **Korsakoff's psychosis**
		- **Wernicke's encephalopathy**
	- **Wet:** Cardiac beri-beri (wet as it causes generalised oedema)
		- Biventricular failure
		- Generalised oedema
		- Pulmonary oedema

#### Treatment
- Wet and Wernicke's should be treated by IV vit-B and C mixture
- Korsakoff's: irreversible, nonresponsive to thiamin
	

### B$_{12}$ deficiency
#### Functions of B$_{12}$
- Recycles folate $\rightarrow$ essential for **cell division**
 (especially in RBC)
- **Myelination**

#### Features
- **Megaloblastic anaemia**
- **Glossitis**
- **Neurologic features**
	- Peripheral neuropathy
	- Autonomic neuropathy
	- Optic atropy
	- Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord

#### Treatment
- Vit-B$_{12}$ IM
- If combined folate and B$_{12}$ deficiency, only folate should not be
 given without B$_{12}$, as B$_{12}$ gets used up in folate recycling,
 deteriorating the B$_{12}$ deficiency symptoms. Always give both together.
